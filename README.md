# Face-Recognition-
Face Recognition with Python &amp; OpenCV

##Nice to know:
This deep learning project is made to develop human face recognition project with python libraries dlib and face_recognition APIs (of OpenCV).

It also demonstrate face_recognition API. Implemented this python project in two parts:

In the first part, to store the information about human face structure, i.e face embedding.
In the second part,  to recognize the person by comparing the new face embeddings with the stored one.
