Face Recognition with Python &amp; OpenCV

##Nice to know:
This deep learning project teaches  how to develop human face recognition project with python libraries dlib and face_recognition APIs (of OpenCV).

It also covers the introduction to face_recognition API. Implemented this python project in two parts:

In the first part, to store the information about human face structure, i.e face embedding and got to learn how to store these embeddings.
In the second part,  to recognize the person by comparing the new face embeddings with the stored one.
